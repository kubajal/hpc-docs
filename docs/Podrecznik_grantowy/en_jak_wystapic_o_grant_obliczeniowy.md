### ICM grant management system (IcmGrants)

Computational resources are provided to the grant owner based on the
submitted application form. To generate the form and its further
processing the *ICM grant management system* at
<https://granty.icm.edu.pl/IcmGrants> should be used.

The system allows to:

 - submit ICM account application,
 - submit ICM grant application,
 - add grant members/users,
 - submit annual grant reports,
 - add papers and other works that benefited from the ICM Infrastructure.

### How to prepare the grant application

Note: Application form to access the Cray system (**Okeanos**) are
available [here](./en_konkurs_okeanos.md)

**Grant cpplications to access Hydra, Topola, Boreasz, Nostromo**

Upon accessing the grant management system at
<https://granty.icm.edu.pl/IcmGrants> it is necessary to:

  - Log in using previously [obtained credentials](./en_zakladanie_konta.md),
  - Access tab ***Utwórz grant***,
  - Fill in the form **Dodawanie grantu**:
    - Project title,
    - Field of study (select one or provide your own),
    - Select the required software. If not applicable - leave the choice of ABINIT software package,
    - Add hardware requirements, e.g. number of CPUs, memory, disk space or a particular cluster,
    - Add any additional requirements (system or network configuration etc.),
    - Add grant members/users,
    - Select an estimated grant duration (in months). After this time, the grant should be closed and, if desired, a new grant application should be submitted - either as a continuation or a new project,
    - Provide the keywords related to the project and used methodology (those will be used for searching the grant database),
    - Abstract in plain text (at least a dozen sentences describing the project, calculations, and justification to use the HPC Infrastructure,
    - For PhD students: Provide the name of your scientific/research tutor who will accept your project.

  - Confirm/save the form with **zatwierdzić dane**.

      - Note: if the information has not been confirmed/saved, it is likely that an error occured in the form - it will be indicated at the form gap containing an error (e.g. provided text is too long).

  - After confirming the information, a new form appears: **Dodawanie
    użytkownika do grantu** (Note: This can also be done after the
    grant is activated).

**NOTE**: Being a grant owner, you are not automatically designated as its member/user. To be able to run the calculations within the grant, you need to have an ICM account: you may add a user who already has one, add a new user, and add yourself as a user. If you won't do the latter, the user account won't be created for you.

  - Add the grant owner **CV** as a PDF file.

  - As a final step: Generate the application with **Wyświetl plik PDF zgłoszenia grantu**.

### Grant activation

After filling the application form and successfully generating the application PDF, it is necessary to:

  - Read the [Terms of Service](../O_zasobach_ICM/Formalnosci/en_regulamin.md),

  - Sign the application (as the grant owner) and the user forms (as the grant users).
    
  - Send the scanned application to pomoc([monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#Names_in_other_languages))icm.edu.pl. The signed and scanned user forms should also be attached (PDF files are available at the grant users login names).

The grant will be activated within 5 work days after the application
has been submitted. To gain access to a particular machine, an e-mail
should be sent to
pomoc([monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#Names_in_other_languages))icm.edu.pl.

### Adding grant members

The grant owner, upon accessing tab **Moje granty** and choosing an
appropriate grant on the list, can add the grant members.

  - Add a member who doesn't have an ICM account,
    - Choose **dodaj użytkownika do grantu** and fill in the form. Please note in particular:
      -Add institution/unit - you may choose on from the provided list. If not listed, please add it manually
    to the database with **Dodaj instytucję/jednostkę**. It takes two
    steps: (1) add main institution (e.g. University of Warsaw), (2)
    add the unit within the main institution (i.e. faculty/department
    etc.). Then choose the added instituion and unit with **dodaj
    jednostkę do instytucji**.

    - Phone number/Telefon - your phone number.

    - E-mail address to which the ICM notifications will be sent.

    - Login - used to access the grant management system, ICM machines and your e-mail username at ICM (login@icm.edu.pl); max. 8 characters or digits, no special characters.
    

  - Add a member who already has an ICM (e.g. is an owner/member of another grant)
    - Choose **dodaj istniejącego użytkownika do grantu** option and select the user from the provided list. The user will be added to the grant automatically. Please note that it's also necessary for a new user to contact <pomoc@icm.edu.pl> to gain access to the machines or particular software.

### Grant owner responsibilities

Grant owner, after the grant has been activated, should:

  - Verify information on the grant members, e.g. report the accounts that should be closed, ammend contact information, etc.
  - Update the grant abstract, if necessary,
  - Update institution details, if changed, for every grant member,
  - Respect the software license agreements,
  - Add the project-related papers/publications in the grant management system,
  - To every grant-related publication, the following clause should be added:

  '''This research was carried out with the support of the
Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling
(ICM), University of Warsaw, under grant no Gxx-xx '''

  - Once a year, Submit a [grant report](./en_sprawozdania_i_publikacje_w_grancie.md),
  - Once a year, participate in the ICM Users Conference (e-mail notifications).

### Multiple grants

The grant owner may have more than one active ICM grant. New grant applications should be submitted if:

  - Time declared in the grant application is soon to be exceeded (max. 24 months),
  - A new, unrelated project is planned.
